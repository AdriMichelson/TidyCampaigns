It’s usually membership based information or a nonprofit charges an engineer to attempt to teach others. Or you open a consultancy shop for a price. None of these things are bad. I have just found in my experience of learning I found success reading books and working through problems like R for Data Science or Advance R.\nThere are growing opportunities where this is changing but I want to openly share general interdisciplenary knowledge, technical skills, and tools that have been helpful to my work.\nIn this site (a quarto book) I will compile my opinions on analysis, data science, and organizing for people to utilize to further democratic wins up and down the ticket.\nI am doing it in a blog style because I hope, as a resource, it is most benefical compiled together as it’s own entity. one that it encourages others who want to contribute directly to it to open source their thoughts to the community as a whole.\nAnd with the R open source community as an inspiration, my approach will be to simulate two campaigns.
